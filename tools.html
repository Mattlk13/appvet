	<p>
		AppVet requires the integration of tools to perform testing and
		analysis of apps. In an AppVet system, tools are required to be
		accessible online and support AppVet communication protocols. Such
		tools are referred to as "AppVet-compatible" and are denoted by the <img
			src="images/tool_checkmark.png" alt="AppVet Tool"
			style="height: 25px;"> logo. For example, Figure 1 shows the
		integration between AppVet and an AppVet-compatible online tool called
		<code>mysec</code>
		. <br> <br> <br>

	</center>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>
		To integrate AppVet with a tool, AppVet must be configured using a <i>tool
			adapter</i>. A tool adapter is an XML file that is provided by a tool
		vendor that defines information about the tool including the tool's
		URL and data that should be sent to the tool when submitting an app
		for testing. In Figure 1, for example, the tool adapter
		<code>android_mysec_tool.xml</code>
		is used by AppVet to integrate with the
		<code>mysec</code>
		tool.
	</p>
	<p>
		Regardless of whether or not a tool resides on a remote server or on
		the same server as AppVet, AppVet communicates with tools via HTTP
		messages. For messages from AppVet to a tool, the tool's REST API is
		used by AppVet while messages from tools to AppVet use AppVet's API.
		Although some vendors may implement their own API for their tool,
		AppVet provides a <i>service wrapper</i> The basic communication
		protocol between AppVet and a tool is asynchronous. When an app is
		sent to a tool from AppVet, the sends an acknowledgement back to
		AppVet before testing the app. After the tool is done testing the app,
		it authenticates with AppVet and submits a report and risk assessment
		for the app. After AppVet receives the report and risk assessment, it
		returns an acknowledgement back to the tool.
	</p>
	<p>
		In addition to configuring AppVet to integrate with a tool, a tool
		must also be configured to integrate with AppVet. Configuration of a
		tool to integrate with AppVet requires configuration of the tool's
		<code>ToolProperties.xml</code>
		file. The
		<code>ToolProperties.xml</code>
		file defines information used by the tool to process apps (e.g.,
		report strings to scan for determining risk assessment) as well as to
		authenticate with AppVet (e.g., username and password). Thus, AppVet
		must have an account for each tool that it integrates with and each
		tool must include its AppVet account information in its
		<code>ToolProperties.xml</code>
		file.
	</p>
	<p>
		In many cases, a standalone tool will be available but will not have
		any network capability. In such cases, AppVet provides a <i>service
			wrapper</i> that allows vendors to "wrap" their standalone tool and
		convert it to an online tool service that will seamless integrate with
		AppVet. Figure 2 shows an example of how a standalone tool
		<code>mytool</code>
		is wrapped by an AppVet service wrapper
		<code>myonlinetool</code>
		. <br> <br> <br>

		<p class="cap">Figure 2. Tool service wrapper.</p>
	</center>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>
		Here, AppVet is configured to integrate with
		<code>myonlinetool</code>
		via its
		<code>android_myonlinetool_tool.xml</code>
		file. When an app is submitted from AppVet to
		<code>myonlinetool</code>
		,
		<code>myonlinetool</code>
		then executes
		<code>mytool</code>
		on the received app and generates a report and risk assessment which
		are fed back to
		<code>myonlinetool</code>
		and submitted to AppVet.

	<h2 id="app_vetting">App Vetting</h2>
	App vetting is a process aimed at determining if a mobile application (or <i>app</i>) conforms
	to an organization's security requirements and that the app is safe to
	deploy on the organization's mobile devices. An app vetting process is
	performed on an app after the app has been developed and released for
	distribution but prior to its deployment on an organization&lsquo;s
	mobile devices. Thus, an app vetting process is distinguished from
	software assurance processes that may occur during the software
	development life cycle of an app. Although an app vetting process
	typically involves analysis of an app&lsquo;s compiled, binary
	representation, it can also involve analysis of the app&lsquo;s source
	code if it is available. An app vetting process comprises a sequence of
	activities:

	<ul>
		<li>App Submission</li>
		<li>App Testing</li>
		<li>Report and Risk Auditing</li>
		<li>App Approval/Rejection</li>
		<li>App Deployment</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>App Submission</h3>
	<p>
		An app vetting process begins when an app is submitted by an <i>Administrator</i>
		or <i>Mobile Device Manager (MDM)</i> to an <i>Analyst</i> for
		processing. An Administrator or MDM is a member of an organization
		that is responsible for deploying, maintaining, and securing the
		organization&lsquo;s mobile devices as well as ensuring that deployed
		devices and their installed apps conform to the organization&lsquo;s
		security requirements. An Analyst is a member of an organization that
		is responsible for managing the app vetting process. Apps that are
		submitted by an Administrator or MDM for testing may be acquired from
		a number of third-party sources including app stores, web sites, or
		directly from developers. Note that the activities surrounding an
		Administrator&lsquo;s acquisition of an app are not included as part of an app
		vetting process.
	</p>
	<h3>App Testing</h3>
	<p>
		When an Analyst receives an app for processing, the Analyst will submit the app to one or more <i>Analyzers</i>
		for testing. An Analyzer is a standalone tool, online tool, or human
		that tests an app for certain characteristics with respect to   
		efficiency, reliability, security, <i>etc</i>. After testing
		an app, an Analyzer will generates a report that identifies detected
		software characteristics. In addition, the analyzer will generate a risk
		score that estimates the likelihood that the detected characteristic
		will be exploited and the impact that the detected characteristic may
		have on the app or its related device or network. Risk scores are
		typically represented as ordinal values indicating the severity of the
		risk (e.g., low-, moderate-, or high-risk).
	</p>
	<h3>Report and Risk Auditing</h3>
	<p>
		After a report and risk score are generated by an Analyzer, they
		are made available to one or more <i>Auditors</i> of the organization.
		An Auditor is a member of the organization that inspects reports and
		risk scores from one or more Analyzers to ensure that an app
		meets the efficiency, reliability, and security requirements of the organization. An Auditor also
		evaluates additional criteria to determine if the app violates any
		organization-specific security requirements that cannot be ascertained
		by the Analyzers such as those that pertain to the use of the app (e.g., 
		Classified apps must not be used by non-classified personnel).
	</p>
	<h3>App Approval/Rejection</h3>
	<p>
		After evaluating reports, risk scores, and additional criteria
		from all Analyzers, the Auditor(s) then collates this information into a
		single report and risk score and derives a recommendation for
		approving or rejecting the app for deployment based on the overall
		security (and efficiency/reliability) posture of the app. This recommendation is made available to
		an <i>Approver</i> who is a high-level member of the organization
		responsible for determining which apps may be deployed on the
		organization&lsquo;s mobile devices. An Approver uses the
		recommendations provided by one or more Auditors, as well as possibly
		other criteria, to determine the organization&lsquo;s official
		approval or rejection of an app.
			</p>
	<h3>App Deployment</h3>
	<p>
	If an app is approved by the Approver, the Administrator or MDM is then
	permitted to deploy the app on the organization's mobile devices. If,
	however, the app is rejected, the organization will follow specified
	procedures for identifying a suitable alternative app or rectifying
	issues with the problematic app. Figure 1 shows the general app vetting
	process:

	<h2 id="appvet">AppVet</h2>
	AppVet is a web application for managing and automating the app vetting
	process, from the submission and testing of apps to the auditing of 
	reports/risk scores and the approval/rejection of apps.
	Through the specification of APIs, schemas
	and requirements, AppVet is designed to easily and seamlessly integrate
	with a wide variety of third-party test tools  
	including static and dynamic analyzers, anti-virus scanners, and
	vulnerability repositories as well as clients including 
	app stores and continuous integration environments. In addition, AppVet 
	provides a user interface (UI) that allows administrators, analysts, auditors, 
	and approvers to manually upload apps, view  
	reports and risk scores, provide recommendations and approve/reject 
	apps. The AppVet UI is shown in Figure 3.

	<p>An AppVet system is a distributed system that comprises the
		AppVet web application and its associated third-party tools and
		clients. In an AppVet system, the app vetting workflow begins when a
		client or user submits an app to AppVet. When AppVet receives an app, it
		registers the app and automatically submits the app and related information to
		one or more Analyzers for testing. Unlike the general app vetting process 
		where Analyzers may be standalone tools, online tools, or human analysts, 
		AppVet requires Analyzers to be available as online tools in order to facilitate 
		the automated testing of apps. For standalone tools, AppVet provides a <i>service
			wrapper</i> that can be used to convert a standalone tool into an online
		tool.
		</p>
		<p>
		When an Analyzer completes its
		testing, it returns a report and risk score to AppVet. When
		AppVet receives reports and risk scores from all Analyzers, it
		then computes an overall risk score for the app and make this information,
		along with all reports and risk scores, available to one or more
		Auditors that, in turn, will use this information to derive a
		recommendation for approving or rejecting an app. This recommendation
		will then be used by an Approver to officially approve or reject the
		app for deployment on the organization's mobile devices. The AppVet
		system architecture is shown in Figure 2.</p>

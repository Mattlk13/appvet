	<h2 id="app_vetting">What is App Vetting?</h2>
	App vetting is a process for ensuring the security, reliability, and
	efficiency of mobile applications (or <i>apps</i>). This process is performed on an app
	after the app has been developed and released for distribution but
	prior to its deployment on an organization&lsquo;s mobile device. Thus, an
	app vetting process is distinguished from software assurance processes
	that may occur during the software development life cycle of an app.
	Note that an app vetting process typically involves analysis of an
	app&lsquo;s compiled, binary representation but can also involve analysis of
	the app&lsquo;s source code if it is available. An app vetting process comprises a sequence of activities:

	<ul>
		<li>App Submission</li>
		<li>App Testing</li>
		<li>Report and Risk Auditing</li>
		<li>App Approval/Rejection</li>
		<li>App Deployment</li>
	</ul>


	<p>
		An app vetting process begins when an app is submitted by an <i>Administrator</i>
		or <i>Mobile Device Administrator (MDM)</i> to an <i>Analyst</i> for
		processing. An Administrator or MDM is a member of the
		organization who is responsible for deploying, maintaining, and
		securing an organization&lsquo;s mobile devices as well as ensuring that
		deployed devices and their installed apps conform to the
		organization&lsquo;s security requirements. An Analyst is a member of the
		organization that is responsible for managing the app vetting process.
		Apps that are submitted by an Administrator or MDM for testing may be
		acquired from a number of third-party sources including app stores,
		web sites, or directly from developers. Note that the activities
		surrounding an Administrator&lsquo;s acquisition of an app are not part of
		an app vetting process.
	</p>

	<p>
		When an Analyst receives an app for processing, the Analyst may
		conduct some pre-processing of the app to extra meta-data from the app and
		to ensure that the app is fit for processing. After an app has been
		pre-processed, the Analyst then submits the app to one or
		more <i>Analyzers</i> for testing. An Analyzer is a testing tool, testing service, or human that
		tests an app for specific software vulnerabilities. After testing an
		app, an Analyzer will generates a report that identifies detected
		software vulnerabilities. In addition, the analyzer generates a risk
		assessment that estimates the likelihood that a detected vulnerability
		will be exploited and the impact that the detected vulnerability may
		have on the app or its related device or network. Risk assessments are
		typically represented as ordinal values indicating the severity of the
		risk (e.g., low-, moderate-, or high-risk).
	</p>

	<p>
		After the report and risk assessment are generated by an Analyzer,
		they are made available to one or more <i>Auditors</i> of the
		organization. An Auditor is a member of the organization that inspects
		reports and risk assessments from one or more Analyzers to ensure that
		an app meets the security requirements of the organization. An Auditor
		also evaluates additional criteria to determine if the app violates
		any organization-specific security requirements that cannot be
		ascertained by the Analyzers. Such requirements typically pertain to 
		restrictions surrounding the use of the app (e.g., Apps must not record audio or
		video).
	</p>
	<p>
		After evaluating reports, risk assessments, and additional criteria
		from all Analyzers, the Auditor then collates this information into a
		single report and risk assessment and derives a recommendation for
		approving or rejecting the app for deployment based on the overall
		security posture of the app. This recommendation is made available to
		an <i>Approver</i> who is a high-level member of the organization
		responsible for determining which apps may be deployed on the
		organization&lsquo;s mobile devices. An Approver uses the recommendations
		provided by one or more Auditors, as well as possibly other criteria, to determine
		the organization&lsquo;s official approval or rejection of an app. If an app
		is approved by the Approver, the Administrator is then permitted to
		deploy the app on the organization's mobile devices. If, however, the
		app is rejected, the organization will follow specified procedures for
		identifying a suitable alternative app or rectifying issues with the
		problematic app.Figure 1 shows this general app vetting process:

	<h2 id="appvet">AppVet</h2>
	AppVet is a web application and service for managing and automating the
	app vetting process. AppVet facilitates the app vetting workflow by
	providing an intuitive user interface for submitting and testing apps,
	managing reports, and assessing risk. Through the specification of APIs, 
	schemas and requirements, AppVet is designed to easily and seamlessly integrate
	with a wide variety of clients including users, apps stores, and
	continuous integration environments as well as third-party tools
	including static and dynamic analyzers, anti-virus scanners, and
	vulnerability repositories.

	<p>An AppVet system is a distributed system that comprises the
		AppVet web application and its associated third-party tools and
		clients. In an AppVet system, the app vetting workflow begins when a
		client submits an app to AppVet. When AppVet receives an app, it
		registers the app and performs some pre-processing of the app. After
		pre-processing an app, AppVet sends the app and related information to
		one or more Analyzers for testing. When an Analyzer
		completes its testing, it returns a report and risk assessment to
		AppVet. When AppVet receives reports and risk assessments from all 
		Analyzers, it then computes an overall risk assessment and make this
		information, along with all reports and risk assessments, available to 
		one or more Auditors that, in turn, will use this information to derive a recommendation 
		for approving or rejecting an app. This recommendation will then be used 
		by an Approver to officially approve or reject the app for deployment on 
		the organization's mobile devices. The AppVet system 
		architecture is shown in Figure 2.</p>

	<h2>AppVet Clients</h2>
	<p>An AppVet system comprises clients that submit apps to AppVet
		and consume reports and risk assessments. Clients include users (such
		as Administrators/MDMs, developers and analysts) and applications
		(such as app stores and continuous integration environments). Using a
		web browser, users access AppVet via the AppVet User Interface (UI)
		shown in Figure 3. The AppVet UI provides support for uploading apps,
		accessing reports and assessing risk. Client applications, on the
		other hand, access AppVet through the AppVet API.</p>

	<h2>AppVet Tool Services</h2>

	An AppVet system comprises Analyzers that test apps for software
	vulnerabilities. In a manual app vetting process, an Analyzer may be a
	third-party testing tool, testing service, or human that tests an app for specific
	software vulnerabilities. To facilitate automated testing of an app,
	however, AppVet requires that Analyzers be made available as online
	testing services. AppVet
	supports the integration of third-party testing services by providing
	APIs, protocols, and other specifications. For standalone tools, 
	AppVet also provides a
	<i>service wrapper</i> that can be used to convert a standalone tool
	into an online testing service.

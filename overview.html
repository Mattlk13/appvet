	<h1>Overview</h1>
	AppVet is a simple, open-source web service and framework for vetting
	mobile applications. AppVet facilitates the app vetting workflow by
	providing an intuitive user interface for submitting and testing apps,
	accessing reports, and assessing risk. Through the specification of
	simple APIs and requirements, AppVet is designed to easily and
	seamlessly integrate with a wide variety of clients including apps
	stores and continuous integration environments as well as third-party
	analysis tools including static and dynamic analyzers, anti-virus
	scanners, and vulnerability repositories.

	<h1>AppVet System</h1>
	An AppVet system comprises the AppVet web service and its associated
	tools and clients. In an AppVet system, the app vetting workflow begins
	when a client submits an app to AppVet. When AppVet receives an app, it
	registers the app and performs some pre-processing of the app.
	Preprocessing is used to extract meta-data about an app and possibly
	provide additional functionality such as ensuring that the app conforms
	to specific requirements of the hosting organization. After
	preprocessing an app, AppVet sends the app and related information to
	one or more tools for testing and evaluation. When a tool completes its
	analysis, it returns a report and risk assessment to AppVet which, in
	turn, makes them available to clients. In addition, AppVet generates an
	overall risk assessment based on risk assessments from all tools. The
	AppVet system architecture is shown in Figure 2-1.


	<h1>AppVet Clients</h1>

	An AppVet system comprises clients that submit apps to the system and
	consume reports and risk assessments. Clients include users (such as
	developers and analysts) and applications (such as app stores and
	continuous integration environments). Using a web browser, users access
	AppVet via the AppVet App Management Interface (AMI) shown in Figure
	2-2. The AMI provides support for uploading apps, accessing reports and
	assessing risk. Client applications, on the other hand, access AppVet
	through the AppVet API.

	<h1>AppVet Tool Services</h1>

	An AppVet system comprises tools that analyze apps for security
	vulnerabilities. A tool may be provided by a third-party vendor, tool
	developer, or user that leverages an existing tool. In an AppVet
	system, tools must be available as online services called tool
	services. To facilitate integration of a tool service with AppVet,
	AppVet requires a service to implement a simple REST API for submitting
	apps to, and receiving reports and risk assessments from, the service.
	AppVet defines three types of tool services: synchronous, asynchronous,
	and push tool services.
	
	<h2>Synchronous Tool Services</h2>
	
	A synchronous tool service is a service that accepts an app from AppVet via an HTTP Request and responds with a report and risk assessment via the corresponding HTTP Response. Because clients will block waiting for a response from a synchronous tool service, such services are aimed at analyses that can be performed relatively quickly. Figure 2-3 shows the AppVet synchronous tool service protocol.

	For more information on synchronous tool services, see the Synchronous Service API. For tool services that take an extended amount of time to analyze an app, an asynchronous tool service may be used.
	
	<h2>Asynchronous Tool Services</h2>
	
	An asynchronous tool service is a service that accepts an app from AppVet via an HTTP Request and immediately responds with an HTTP 202 Accepted indicating that the app was accepted for processing. After processing the app, the service will then send a report and risk assessment via an HTTP Request to AppVet. Figure 2-4 shows the AppVet asynchronous tool service protocol. 
	
	For more information on asynchronous services, see the Asynchronous Service API.

	<h2 id="starting">Starting AppVet</h2>

	<p>
		To start AppVet, start the Tomcat service. After Tomcat is started,
		open a browser to your AppVet URL
		<code>https://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/appvet where
			&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;</code>
		is the hostname or IP address and port number of your server. The
		AppVet login screen should be visible as shown in Figure 1.

	<br>
	<br>

	<h2 id="ui">Using AppVet</h2>
	<p>After logging into AppVet, the AppVet app management interface
		is displayed as shown in Figure 2.</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<center>
		<img src="images/appvet_ui.png" alt="AppVet UI" style="height: 400px;">

	</center>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>
		The AppVet app management interface comprises two main panels: an <i>apps
			list</i> panel on the left and an app information panel on the right. The
		apps list panel displays apps that have been uploaded to the system
		while the app information panel displays information about the
		selected app. The apps list panel displays general information about
		uploaded apps including their AppVet-generated app ID, app name,
		current status and risk assessment, user (app owner), and the
		date/time when the app was uploaded to the system. The app info panel
		contains information about a selected app including:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>App name and icon
		<li>Version number
		<li>Registration and app pre-processing statuses
		<li>Tool reports
		<li>Tool status and risk assessments
	</ul>

	<h3>Operation Buttons</h3>
	The apps list panel contains operation buttons used to manage apps and
	their related reports. Table 1 describes the functions of AppVet
	operation buttons.
	<br>
	<br>

	<h3>Menus</h3>
	<p>
		AppVet provides three menus: <b>User</b>, <b>Help</b>, and <b>Admin</b>.
		The <b>User</b> menu is displayed as the user's first name and first
		letter of the last name in the top left corner as shown in Figure 3.
	</p>

	<br>
	<br>
	<center>
		<img src="images/menu_user.png" alt="AppVet Menus"> <br> <br>
		<p class="cap">Figure 3. AppVet Menu.</p>
	</center>
	<br>
	<br> The
	<b>User</b> menu allows users to edit their account information (via
	Account Settings), view apps that they have uploaded (via
	<b>My Apps</b>), or log out (via
	<b>Logout</b>).
	<p>
		The <b>Help</b> menu provides help-related information including a
		link to the AppVet website.
	<p>
		For AppVet administrators, the <b>Admin</b> menu provides access to
		the AppVet system log and user management functions. In the app
		information panel, each tool is associated with a processing
		status or risk assessment as shown in Figure 5-4.
	<h3>Tool Status</h3>

	In the app information panel, each tool is associated with a
	processing status or risk assessment as shown in Figure 4.

	<br>
	<br>
	<center>
		<img src="images/tool_status_screenshot.png" alt="AppVet Tool Status">
		<br> <br>
		<p class="cap">Figure 4. App Tools Status.</p>
	</center>
	<br>
	<br> A tool status indicates the current processing status
	of, or the risk assessment generated by, a tool. In general,
	the risk assessment generated by a tool should conform to a
	standardized risk scoring system, such as the Common Vulnerability
	Scoring System (CVSS). AppVet requires that these assessments be mapped
	to one of three risk categories: LOW , MODERATE , or HIGH . Table 2
	describes these risk assessment categories and AppVet tool
	statuses.
	<p>
	<br>
<br>
<center>
		<p class="cap">Table 2. Tool statuses and risk assessments.</p>
	<table>
		<tbody><tr>
			<th>Type</th>
			<th>Tool Status</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td rowspan="5">Processing Status</td>
			<td>N/A</td>
			<td>No status information is available for the tool.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>PENDING</td>
			<td>App is waiting to be submitted to the tool.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>SUBMITTED</td>
			<td>App has been submitted to the tool.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>PROCESSING</td>
			<td>The tool is analyzing the app.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>ERROR</td>
			<td>The tool could not analyze the app.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td rowspan="3">Risk Assessment</td>
			<td>LOW</td>
			<td>The tool designates the app as low-risk.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>MODERATE</td>
			<td>The tool designates the app as moderate-risk.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>HIGH</td>
			<td>The tool designates the app as high-risk.</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</center>
<br>
<br>
<br> Note that a risk assessment is only displayed after the tool
has successfully completed processing. Further note that risk
assessments generated by a tool can be later overridden if
needed. This feature is used to mitigate false positive analysis
results.
	
		<h3>App Status</h3>
	In the apps list panel, each app is associated with a status or risk
assessment as shown in Figure 5.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<center>
	<img width="700px" src="images/app_status.png" alt="app_status">
	<br> <br> 
			<p class="cap">Figure 5. App status.</p>
	
</center>
<br>
<br>
<br> An app status indicates the current status or risk assessment
of an app which, in turn, is based on the statuses and risk assessments
of the tools. Table 3 describes the AppVet app statuses and
risk assessments.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<center>
			<p class="cap">Table 5-3. App status and risk assessments.</p>
</b> <br> <br>
	<table>
		<tbody><tr>
			<th>Type</th>
			<th>App Status</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td rowspan="4">Processing Status</td>
			<td>REGISTERING</td>
			<td>App is being registered by AppVet.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>PENDING</td>
			<td>App is waiting to be analyzed.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>PROCESSING</td>
			<td>App is being analyzed by one or more tools.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>ERROR</td>
			<td>One or more tools could not analyze the app.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td rowspan="3">Risk Assessment</td>
			<td>LOW</td>
			<td>All tools designate the app as low-risk.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>MODERATE</td>
			<td>At least one tool designates te app as
				moderate-risk, but no tool designates the app as high-risk.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>HIGH</td>
			<td>At least one tool designates the app as high-risk.</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</center>
<br>
<br>
<br> 
Note that if a risk assessment is displayed, processing for the app has completed.
<p>
Note that the decision to approve or reject an app is dependent upon the
policies and security requirements of the organization that owns and
operates the instance of AppVet. In addition, overall risk assessments
generated by AppVet are based solely on the risk assessments provided by
the tools used.

	<h2 id="starting">Starting AppVet</h2>

	<p>
		To start AppVet, start the Tomcat service and 
		open a browser to your AppVet URL
		<code>https://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/appvet where
			&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;</code>
		is the hostname or IP address and port number of your server. The
		AppVet login screen should be visible as shown in Figure 1.

	<h2 id="ui">Using AppVet</h2>
	<p>After logging into AppVet, the AppVet app management interface
		is displayed as shown in Figure 2.</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<center>
		<img src="images/full.png" alt="AppVet UI" style="height: 400px;">

	</center>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>
		The AppVet app management interface comprises two main panels: an <i>apps
			list</i> panel on the left and an app information panel on the right. The
		apps list panel displays apps that have been uploaded to the system
		while the app information panel displays information about the
		selected app (highlighted in blue in the apps list panel). The apps list panel displays general information about
		uploaded apps including their AppVet-generated app ID, app name,
		current status and risk score, user (app owner), and the
		date/time when the app was uploaded to the system. The app info panel
		contains information about a selected app including:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>App name and icon
		<li>Version number
		<li>Registration and app pre-processing statuses
		<li>Tool reports
		<li>Tool status and risk scores
	</ul>

	<h3>Operation Buttons</h3>
	The apps list panel contains operation buttons used to manage apps and
	their related reports. Table 1 describes the functions of AppVet
	operation buttons.
	<br>
	<br>
	<center>
		<table>
			<p class="cap">Table 1. Operation buttons.</p>

	<h3>Tool and Report Statuses</h3>

	In the app information panel, each tool or report is associated with a
	processing status or risk score as shown in Figure 4.

	<br>
	<br>
	<center>
		<img src="images/tool_status_screenshot.png" alt="AppVet Tool Status">
		<br> <br>
		<p class="cap">Figure 4. App Tools Status.</p>
	</center>
	<br>
	<br> A tool or report status indicates the current processing status
	of, or the risk score generated by, a tool or analyst. 
	AppVet requires that risk scores be mapped
	to one of three risk categories: LOW, MODERATE, or HIGH. Table 2
	describes these risk score categories and AppVet tool
	statuses.
	<p>
	<br>
<br>
<center>
		<p class="cap">Table 2. Tool statuses and risk scores.</p>
	<table>
		<tbody><tr>
			<th>Type</th>
			<th>Tool Status</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td rowspan="6">Processing Status</td>
			<td>N/A</td>
			<td>No status information is available for the tool.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>PENDING</td>
			<td>App is waiting to be submitted to the specified tool.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>SUBMITTED</td>
			<td>App has been submitted to the specified tool.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>COMPLETED</td>
			<td>Pre-processing of the app has been completed.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>AVAILABLE</td>
			<td>A report is available.</td>
		</tr>
		
		<tr>
			<td>ERROR</td>
			<td>The tool could not analyze the app.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td rowspan="3">Risk score</td>
			<td>LOW</td>
			<td>The tool (or analyst) has designated the app as low-risk.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>MODERATE</td>
			<td>The tool (or analyst) has designated the app as moderate-risk.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>HIGH</td>
			<td>The tool (or analyst) has designated the app as high-risk.</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</center>
<br>
<br>
<br> Note that a risk score is only displayed after the tool
has successfully completed processing. Further note that risk
scores generated by a tool can be overridden if
needed. This feature is used to mitigate false positive analysis
results.
	
		<h3>App Status</h3>
	In the apps list panel, each app is associated with a status or risk
score as shown in Figure 5.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<center>
	<img width="700px" src="images/app_status.png" alt="app_status">
	<br> <br> 
			<p class="cap">Figure 5. App status.</p>
	
</center>
<br>
<br>
<br> An app status indicates the current status or risk score
of an app which, in turn, is based on the statuses and risk scores
of the tools. Table 3 describes the AppVet app statuses and
risk scores.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<center>
			<p class="cap">Table 5-3. App status and risk scores.</p>
</b> <br> <br>
	<table>
		<tbody><tr>
			<th>Type</th>
			<th>App Status</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td rowspan="4">Processing Status</td>
			<td>REGISTERING</td>
			<td>App is being registered by AppVet.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>PENDING</td>
			<td>App is waiting to be analyzed.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>PROCESSING</td>
			<td>App is being analyzed by one or more tools.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>ERROR</td>
			<td>One or more tools could not analyze the app.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td rowspan="3">Risk score</td>
			<td>LOW</td>
			<td>All tools designate the app as low-risk.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>MODERATE</td>
			<td>At least one tool designates te app as
				moderate-risk, but no tool designates the app as high-risk.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>HIGH</td>
			<td>At least one tool designates the app as high-risk.</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</center>
<br>
<br>
<br> 
Note that if a risk score is displayed, processing for the app has completed.
<p>
Note that the decision to approve or reject an app is dependent upon the
policies and security requirements of the organization that owns and
operates the instance of AppVet. In addition, overall risk scores
generated by AppVet are based solely on the risk scores provided by
the tools used.

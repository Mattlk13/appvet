You can edit or overwrite existing AppVet icons. Note that all button icons
are of size 80px(w)x20px(h). Icons of any different size may lead to 
unexpected results. Also, all button icons are transparent. Finally, image
file names must be the same as the original AppVet image files.

The following files represent AppVet button icons:

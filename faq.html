	<hr>
	<h3>What is App Vetting?</h3>
	App vetting is a process for ensuring the security, reliability, and
	efficiency of mobile applications.
	
<h3>What is AppVet?</h3>
AppVet is a web application for managing and automating an app vetting process. 
AppVet helps decision-makers approve or reject apps based on risk assessments 
from multiple test tools.

<h3>Is there a NIST AppVet service where I can submit my app for testing?</h3>
No. NIST does not maintain an operational AppVet service.

<h3>Does NIST accredit or approve apps?</h3>
No. NIST does not accredit or approve apps.

<h3>What analytic capability does AppVet provide out-of-the-box?</h3>
The power of AppVet lies in its ability to easily integrate third-party tools to 
provide tailored analytic capability. AppVet itself provides little analytic 
capability.

<h3>What tool services does AppVet come with?</h3>
The following tool services can be downloaded from GitHub:
<ul>
<li>Android certification tester</li>
<li>Master-Key ExtraField tester</li>
<li>Androwarn</li>
</ul>

<h3>How do I integrate my tool with AppVet?</h3>
See HYPERLINK HERE.

<h3>Does AppVet support iOS, Windows Mobile, etc. apps?</h3>
AppVet can support apps from different platforms so long as there are tools 
available to analyze those apps.

<h3>How is risk assessment derived by a tool?</h3>
The risk assessment of an app by a tool is dependent on the vendor or 
developer of the tool. Here, it is strongly recommended that vendors or tool 
developers adopt a standardized approach such as the Common Vulnerability 
Scoring System (CVSS) to derive risk assessments. AppVet requires that risk 
assessments by a tool be mapped to one of three categories: PASS (low-risk), 
WARNING (moderate-risk), and FAIL (high-risk).

<h3>How does AppVet derive an overall risk assessment for an app?</h3>
AppVet takes a simple approach to deriving an app's risk assessment based on
 the risk assessments from multiple tools. If an app receives low-risk 
 assessments from all tools, then AppVet assigns an overall risk assessment 
 of PASS (low-risk). If an app receives a high-risk assessment from at least
  one tool, then AppVet assigns an overall risk assessment of FAIL (high-risk).
   If an app receives a moderate-risk assessment from at least one tool, but 
   does not receive any high-risk assessments, AppVet assigns an overall risk 
   assessment of WARNING (moderate-risk).
   
<h3>Does an overall risk assessment of PASS or LOW mean that it is ok to use?</h3>
The decision to approve or reject an app is based on the policies and 
requirements of the organization that owns and operates the instance of AppVet, 
regardless of the overall risk assessment generated by AppVet.

<h3>Is AppVet free?</h3>
Yes, AppVet is freely available per the following agreement (HYPERLINK HERE).

<h3>Is AppVet open source?</h3>
Yes,  AppVet is open source and available at GitHub (HYPERLINK HERE).

	<h3 id="appvetting">What is app vetting?</h3>
	App vetting is a process for ensuring the security, reliability, and
	efficiency of mobile applications.

	<h3 id="appvet">What is AppVet?</h3>
	AppVet is a web application for managing and automating an app vetting
	process. AppVet helps decision-makers approve or reject apps based on
	risk assessments from multiple test tools.

	<h3 id="nistservice">Is there a NIST AppVet service where I can submit my app for
		testing?</h3>
	No. NIST does not maintain an operational AppVet service.

	<h3 id="accredit">Does NIST accredit or approve apps?</h3>
	No. NIST does not accredit or approve apps.

	<h3 id="analytic">What analytic capability does AppVet provide out-of-the-box?</h3>
	The power of AppVet lies in its ability to easily integrate third-party
	tools to provide tailored analytic capability. AppVet itself provides
	little analytic capability.

	<h3 id="availabletools">What tools does AppVet come with?</h3>
	The following tools can be downloaded from GitHub:
	<ul>
		<li>Android certification tester</li>
		<li>Master-Key ExtraField tester</li>
		<li>Androwarn</li>
	</ul>

	<h3 id="integrate">How do I integrate my tool with AppVet?</h3>
	See HYPERLINK HERE.

	<h3 id="platforms">Does AppVet support iOS, Windows Mobile, etc. apps?</h3>
	AppVet can support apps from different platforms so long as there are
	tools available to analyze those apps.

	<h3 id="riskassessment">How is risk assessment derived by a tool?</h3>
	The risk assessment of an app by a tool is dependent on the vendor or
	developer of the tool. Here, it is strongly recommended that vendors or
	tool developers adopt a standardized approach such as the Common
	Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) to derive risk assessments. AppVet
	requires that risk assessments by a tool be mapped to one of three
	categories: PASS (low-risk), WARNING (moderate-risk), and FAIL
	(high-risk).

	<h3 id="overallrisk">How does AppVet derive an overall risk assessment for an app?</h3>
	AppVet takes a simple approach to deriving an app's risk assessment
	based on the risk assessments from multiple tools. If an app receives
	low-risk assessments from all tools, then AppVet assigns an overall
	risk assessment of PASS (low-risk). If an app receives a high-risk
	assessment from at least one tool, then AppVet assigns an overall risk
	assessment of FAIL (high-risk). If an app receives a moderate-risk
	assessment from at least one tool, but does not receive any high-risk
	assessments, AppVet assigns an overall risk assessment of WARNING
	(moderate-risk).

	<h3 id="riskuse">Does an overall risk assessment of PASS or LOW mean that it is
		ok to use?</h3>
	The decision to approve or reject an app is based on the policies and
	requirements of the organization that owns and operates the instance of
	AppVet, regardless of the overall risk assessment generated by AppVet.

	<h3 id="free">Is AppVet free?</h3>
	Yes, AppVet is freely available per the following agreement (HYPERLINK
	HERE).

	<h3 id="opensource">Is AppVet open source?</h3>
	Yes, AppVet is open source and available at GitHub (HYPERLINK HERE).

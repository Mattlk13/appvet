	<h3 id="testingservice">Service</h3>
	A service, also known as a
	<i>testing service</i>, is a online service that tests an app for
	security, reliability, or efficiency vulnerabilities or issues. A
	testing service is distinguished from a testing tool by its implementation as
	an online (HTTP) service rather than a standalone program. Tools are required to be converted to a
	testing service in order to be integrated with AppVet.

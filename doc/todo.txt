The following are designated as to-do:

- Remove SYNCHRONOUS/ASYNCHRONOUS since everything is now only asynchronous. 
  This will entail removing/modifying various classes as well as simplifying
  the schema for tool adapters (and possibly the database).
  
- Remove PROXY_URL
  
- Redesign ToolAdapter.xsd schema

- Verify session expiration code:
	- Database.getSessionExpiration() returns java.util.Date but inner code returns java.sql.Timestamp?
	- Database.clearExpiredSessions() seems to remove sessions that are not yet expired.
